Stdout is reserved for signaling back to the Pandium if there was an auth error with one or more of
the configured connectors. You do this by stringing a json object with the following shape:

```json
{
    "Pandium": {
                    "Auth": {
                                "CONNECTOR1_AUTH_STATUS": "Disconnected", 
                                "CONNECTOR2_AUTH_STATUS": "Connected"
                            }
               }
}
```
